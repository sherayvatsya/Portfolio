## ⌨️ Updating the 3D Keyboard Skills

The 3D keyboard keycaps are baked into a Spline file. To update the skills displayed on the keyboard:

1. **Import** the `public/assets/skills-keyboard.spline` file into [Spline](https://spline.design/)
2. **Unhide** the keycap objects you want to edit
3. **Update** the logo images on each keycap to your new skill icons
4. **Rename** each keycap object to match the skill's `name` field in `src/data/constants.ts` (e.g. `js`, `react`, `docker`)
5. **Hide** all keycap objects again
6. **Export** the scene and overwrite `public/assets/skills-keyboard.spline`

After updating the Spline file, make sure `src/data/constants.ts` has matching entries for every skill on the keyboard:

```ts
export const SKILLS: Record<SkillNames, Skill> = {
  js: { name: "js", label: "JavaScript", shortDescription: "...", ... },
  react: { name: "react", label: "React", shortDescription: "...", ... },
  // ... add/remove entries to match your keyboard
};
```

The `SkillNames` enum, `SKILLS` record, and the Spline keycap names must all stay in sync for the keyboard interactions to work correctly.

## 🔌 Realtime Features (Optional)

The portfolio supports optional realtime features powered by a **separate backend API**:

- 🖱️ **Live cursors** — See other visitors' cursors in realtime
- 👥 **Online presence** — Shows who's currently on the site
- 💬 **Chat** — Live chat between visitors

These features activate automatically when the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` environment variable is set. Without it, the portfolio works perfectly fine as a static site — no realtime features, no backend dependency.
